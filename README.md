1 for Video. 
2 for Audio.

We need to input our choice, in numeric mode.

Provide link into command prompt & press 1 white space. (This was most time consuming stage during the upgradation.)

after process user data, it will provide available video quality into that same screen. Please choose by providing number. Actually this time our numeric choice will based on apps prefference & available quality.
